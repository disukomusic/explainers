  <h1>Binary, Hex, and Encoding Numbers</h1>
  <p>This page will explain how numbers are encoded in a few different formats. It's an investigation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system">numeral systems</a>. Specifically, we will be focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation">place-value notation</a>. <em>(These links are interesting, but like much of wikipedia, they are tend to only make sense if you already understand how all this works).</em></p>

  <h2>Why Encode Numbers anyway?</h2>
  <p>This is an unfair question, because we already are encoding numbers. Look at me go: 42. You just parsed a number! You read that as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a>, interpreting the values to be... well, forty two.</p>
  <p>and why roman numerals or tally marks might be different. It's likely that you have some degree of familiarity with encoding numbers in at least some form beyond the decimal system we commonly use.</p>

    <h3>Commonly Used Numeral Systems</h3>
    <h4>Tally Marks</h4>
    <img src="images/tally.png" />
    <p>Draw a line for each mark, and a slash to visually cluster 5 together. The clustering makes it easy to add up the tally's: by 5's instead of by 1s. Tally marks have the advantage of being great for counting, you don't have to remember the tally, you just keep adding marks. They are bad at representing "zero".</p>
    <h4>Dot-and-Line System</h4>
  <img src="images/boxtallynumbers.png" />
  <p><em>The numbers 1 through 10 in the dox-tally system.</em></p>
  <p>The dot-and-line system is another tally system that leaves a cluster every 10 marks, instead of 5. It takes up less space on a page than traditional tally marks. I was taught it randomly one day, and have personally preferred it. The 3, 6, 7, and 9 are not horizontally symmetric, but can be written in either way without losing meaning (I use clockwise marks).</p>

  <p>Roman Numerals is a famous notation, and one you have likely experienced. It supports positive, whole numbers (and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Fractions">fractions</a>, apparently).</p>
  <p>They are generally written by adding up the number values. To keep things compact, there is subtraction involved too, like "IV" for 4. Generally, as you read left-to-right, you add numbers that are larger or the same as the next value to their right, and subtract values that are smaller than the value to their right. You'll only ever subtract a single digit (8 is VIII, because IIX does not work). Most numbers are written as sums only, and large-to-small values. It's a bit more complicated than this, and there are a lot of variations.
  <p>One complication is that there are multiple notations that can readably get to the same value. IIII or IV for 4, for example. Hypothetically, you could just keep adding I's like a tally system, and it would still be readable.</p>
  <p>62 can be written as LXII. 50+10+1+1. Each number gets samller left to right, so we sum. On the other hand, 42 would be "XLII". L is 50, X is 10. XL is 50-10, so 40. II is 2. 50-10+2 = 42.</p>

  <br />
  <p>You might have seen "MCM" a lot. "MCM" is 1000, CM is 900 (1000-100). So MCM is 1900 - and we are probably reading some year.</p>
  <p>MMXXIII is easy, as there is no subtraction: 2023. 2M's plus 2X's plus 3 I's = 2000+20+3.</p>
  <p>There are some strings that are not parseable. "IXI", for example, is "10-1+1". As a puzzle, one might parse this as '10', but it would be considered invalid.</p>

  <h2>Positional Notation</h2>
  <p>Positional Notation is the underlying system powering binary, hexadecimal, decimal, and other useless or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals">archaic</a> notations.</p>
  <p>This discussion will ignore fractions, decimals, and negative values. Sorry!</p>
  <h3>Decimal</h3>
  <p>You already know decimal notation. Breaking it down is useful because of this familiarity. You can then compare and find similar patterns when we break down binary and hexadeximal.</p>
  <p>For decimal, let's invent a handful of symbols to represent some number of values. For example, I can represent values with the following nine symbols: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. (You've probably seen these symbols before).</p>
  <p>Then, I assign each one a numerical value to represent, signified here as a number of dots:</p>
  <img src="images/1through9.png" />
  <p>Uh oh. I'm forgot one. Well, zero. I forgot zero. Let's come up with a symbol to represent no thing... 0. Phew! Math is hard when you don't have zero's! Let's use the following <em>10</em> symbols: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.</p>
  <p>I can represent any value 0 through 9, now. Going larger would require more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal#/media/File:Babylonian_numerals.svg">symbols</a>. More symbols stinks, so let's do something else instead.</p>
  <p>Let's re-use our symbols. Instead of inventing some "ten" symbol, let's re-use the 1, but differentiate it somehow.</p>
  <p>Because we have a zero, we can write our new value to the left of the first value. Now it's clearly different, and we didn't have to do something gross like draw a line over it (Looking at you, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinculum_(symbol)">vinculum</a>).</p>
  <p>Let's have this place represent the number we couldn't before: an amount of 10's. In other words: The number times 10. As you know, this pattern continues. If we move it over another place, we multiply by 10 again, which would be the same as multiplying it by 100.</p>
  <p>1234 becomes "4 plus 3 10's, plus 2 10s of 10s, plus one 10s of 10s of 10s. Or 1 times 1000 plus 2 times a hundred plus 3 times 10 plus 4. 1234.</p>
  <img src="images/1234.png" />
  <p>Remembering our exponents, we can rewrite "10s of 10s of 10s" as "10 to the power of 3", and so on for every place. 10 to the power of 0 is 1.</p>
  <p>This system is "Base 10", where 'base' means the number of unique symbols including zero.</p>
  <h3>Binary</h3>
  <p>Binary is a Base 2 system. We have 2 symbols (0 and 1). To count to 2, we have to move over a place. "10" is one 2s plus 0 ones. "100" is 1 2s of 2s (4). "1000" is 1 2s of 2s of 2s, or 8.</p>
  <p>Each place is 2 to a power. The first 8 places are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. They just double!</p>

  <h4>Binary Properties</h4>
  <h5>How Many Bits?</h5>
  <p>In the general case, we only add places to binary as we need them. In other words, we exclude leading zeros.</p>
  <p>In Binary, it's usually common <em>not</em> to exclude leading zeros. This is because the number of bits (or places) tends to be important context.</p>
  <p>I limited a value </p>
  <h5>Doubling</h5>
  <p>The first is that if you "shift" all of the 1s and 0s to the left, (put a zero in the first place), you <strong>double</strong> the number. </p>
  <p>So if you have 00001011, (11) and shift it to the left (inserting a zero), you get 00010110, which is 22. This is particularly neat, as it helps computers do more complicated math problems (like division!) really fast.</p>
  <p>Shifting the other direction, of course, halves the number.</p>
<h5>Even or Odd?</h5>
  <p>It's trivial to see if a number in Binary is even or odd. Just look at the first digit. If it's a 0, it's even. If it's a 1, it's odd.</p>
  <p>Computers perform this check with a <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/binary/bitwise-operators">bitwise operation</a>, out of the scope of this page.</p>
<h5>Negative Numbers?</h5>
  <p>To represent negative numbers, we could use our left-most digit to no longer represent the value, but act as a negative sign. So our value above, with 8 bits, goes from "-127 to 127" in range, instead of "0 to 255". We have only lost one number by accidentally introducing the concept of "negative zero".</p>
  <p>It turns out that having a negative zero is weird, but even worse is that we can't simply add numbers together anymore!</p>
  <p>One of the most common solutions to this problem is called <strong>Two's Complement</strong>, which you can learn about with this excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qH4unVtJkE">Ben Eater video.</a></p>

  <h3>Hexadecimal</h3>
  <p>It's time for hexadecimal!</p>
  <p>Hexadecimal is base 16, (decimal is base 10, and binary is base 2). It works just the same as the above, each place represents a value 16 times larger than the previous place.</p>
  <p>Frustratingly, Hexadecimal is often abbreviated as "hex". We are referring to hexa<strong>dec</strong>imal, not heximal. Nobody wants base 6. But 16? 16 is great. We love powers of two.</p>
  <p>Let's use the following 16 symbols: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F</p>.
  <p>Yep, we just borrowed from the alphabet. A is 10, B is 11, F is 15.</p>
  <p>The frustration of Hex - it often looks like decimal numbers - also stems from it's simplicity - we are using well known and well-supported characters.</p>
